Introduction
------------

Quantum is a variant of the classical game of Baduk (Go). It is played on two **parallel board realities**, where stones are **entangled** across realities.

Understanding the rules of Baduk is a prerequisite for this rules description.

Parallel Realities
------------------

In Quantum the board exists in two parallel realities. Every move places a stone at the same board position in both realities. The move must be a legal play on both boards individually.

Entangled Stones
----------------

Every stone is entangled with its counterpart in the other reality. When a stone gets captured, the entangled stone also gets captured in the other reality.

Quantum Moves
-------------

The first two moves of the game are Quantum moves that **invert colour** in one reality. The two black stones placed this way are entangled with each other, same for the two white stones.

To highlight Quantum moves, the stones are marked with a green colour.

The positions of quantum stones stay connected after capture, so subsequent moves result in according stone placements in the two realities.

Score
---------

At the end the points for both boards are summed up. Komi is applied once.

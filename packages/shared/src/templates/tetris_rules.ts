Introduction
------------

Tetris Go is a variant of Go / Baduk where in addition to the normal rules, moves that create a chain with a Tetris shape are not allowed.
In other words, players can't create chains of size 4 (and this is how Tetris Go works on non rectangular boards).
Note that players can still create chains of size 5 or more by connecting two chains.

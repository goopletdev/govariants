Tetris Go is a variant of Go / Baduk with one additional rule:

### Moves that create a chain with a Tetris shape are not allowed.

In other words, players can't create chains of size 4, and this is also how Tetris Go works on non rectangular boards.
Players can still create chains of size 5 or more by connecting two chains.
